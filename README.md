# Pizza_Sales_Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a pizza restaurant's sales data to identify key business trends. By cleaning the raw data and applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered insights regarding peak hours, busy days, and seasonal revenue patterns.

Tech Stack:Python (Pandas for data manipulation)
Jubyter Notebook (Development environment)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Advanced data visualization)


Key Business Questions Addressed: 
​Time Trends: When are the peak hours and busiest days for orders?
​Financial Impact: What does the monthly revenue trend look like across the year?
​Product Performance: Which pizza types are the highest earners, and which are underperforming?
​

Featured Visualization: 
[Peak Hour Sales](Peak_hour.png) 
Hourly Peaks: Visualized the "lunch vs. dinner" rush using line plots.

[Monthly Sales Trend](Monthly_sales.png) 
​Monthly Revenue: Identified peak seasonal periods using custom chronological sorting.
​

Key Features: 
​Feature Engineering: Created a revenue column by calculating quantity * price, and also created the day of the week, month, and hour columns to ensure proper analysis.
​Data Cleaning: Handled date/time formatting for accurate chronological plotting.
​Warning-Free Code: Optimized Seaborn plots to comply with the latest documentation standards (handling hue and palette deprecations).
